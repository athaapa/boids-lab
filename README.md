This Boids project attempts to simulate flocking behavior based on [Craig Reynolds' paper](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/). It is written in lua and utilizes the LÃ–VE framework.

This project was inspired by [Sebastian Lague's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw).

A demonstration can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4QoSdG1u2Q
